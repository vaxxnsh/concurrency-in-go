/*
	A deadlocked program is one in which all concurrent processes are waiting on one
	another. In this state, the program will never recover without outside intervention.
*/

/*
	Coffman Conditions For DeadLocks -
		Mutual Exclusion -
			A concurrent process holds exclusive rights to a resource at any one time.
		Wait For Condition -
			A concurrent process must simultaneously hold a resource and be waiting for an
			additional resource.
		No Preemption -
			A resource held by a concurrent process can only be released by that process, so
			it fulfills this condition.
		Circular Wait -
			A concurrent process (P1) must be waiting on a chain of other concurrent processes
			(P2), which are in turn waiting on it (P1), so it fulfills this final condition
			too.
